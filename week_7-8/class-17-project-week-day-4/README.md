# Class 17 -  Project Week: Milestone 4
## Development

1. Start with a meeting to assess how Milestone 3 went, and then plan today accordingly.

2. Your goal today: MVP. You want to have everything working, all of your core features in place, bugs worked out, styling in place.

Keep in mind, that as we get closer to Presentation Day, it's never too soon to start thinking about presentations, and one step I'd encourage getting to at some point today is to test your project on one of the projectors in the classrooms downstairs. It just makes everything a little different to be viewed that way. I'll share some specific strategies for presentation prep tomorrow morning.
