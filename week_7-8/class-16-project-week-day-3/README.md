# Class 16 -  Project Week: Milestone 3
## Development

1. Start with a meeting to assess how Milestone 2 went, and then plan today accordingly.

2. Your goal today: MVP. You want to have everything working, all of your core features in place, and bugs worked out. That will leave tomorrow for stretch goals and focusing on getting the look and feel dialed in to exactly what you want.
